# Classification-Machine-Learning-
## Classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers.
Classification in machine learning is a supervised learning approach in which computer programs try to classify categorical data by observing and learning from observations (labelled data).

It is key for every company to have the aim to increase its profit margins and customer retention so it is important that companies focus their resources in areas that would help them achieve that aim.
Predicting Customer Churn: Exploring Key Indicators and Retention Strategies
Hypothesis
Null hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the customer's characteristics and their likelihood to churn from the company's product or service.

Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between the customer's characteristics and their likelihood to churn from the company's product or service.

This hypothesis can be used to explore the relationship between various customer characteristics, such as gender, age, tenure, internet service provider, contract term, and payment method, and the likelihood of churn. By understanding the key indicators of churn, the organization can develop strategies to retain customers and minimize attrition.

## Questions to achieve the objectives of the project:
1. What is the overall churn rate in the company?
2. How does the churn rate vary with different demographic factors such as gender, senior citizen status, and partner/dependent status?
3. Is there a correlation between the tenure of a customer and the likelihood of churn?
4. Are customers with a specific internet service type more likely to churn than others?
5. Is there a relationship between monthly charges and churn rate?
6. Does the payment method have an impact on the likelihood of churn?
7. Which contract type has the highest churn rate?
8. What are the key indicators of churn?
9. What strategies can be implemented to retain customers and reduce churn?
